	<h2 class="bioTitle">About Me</h2>
	<p>I was born and raised in Fairfax, Virginia. Growing up I loved playing volleyball, video games, and watching movies. I also thoroughly enjoyed playing instruments in elementary and middle school such as the violin, trumpet, and tuba. I graduated with an advanced degree from Chantilly High School in June of 2008. I attended Abilene Christian University in the fall of 2008 until the spring of 2009. I decided to take time off from school, as I had no clarity in which path I wanted to journey down. So, for the next five years while staying in Texas, I held a number of jobs. I had found a community and profession at a premier summer camp called 'Camp Olympia' and would spend the rest of my time in Texas there. In February of 2014, I decided to put in my two weeks at work and move my life to Nashville, TN. After living and work here for three years, I discovered a path that within my self felt worthy of pursuing; Nashville Software School. I sent in my application in January of 2017, interviewed in February, and began NSS Cohort 20 on May 22, 2017. I had begun my journey of becoming a software developer and the sky is the limit.

		<p>"Upon reflection, my first week of software school seems like a blur. So much new content, so many new faces, so many instructors, just so many things. I've reviewed HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript material that I went over before class, and then the instructors gave new info and exercises as a buffer to see where the class as a whole was at. We learned basic CSS-101 styling, we learned what a group project would look like, and even began working on one. Friday, I was assigned to a group of four people and we were given the task to plan and develop a working static website. Each of us briefly talked about out tasks, and almost immediately began working. I believed I had finished my code before the end of the day, and after pushing it up to gitHUB, which I still struggle with, realized that the group was far from done. However, I was excited to work with them to figure out how to complete our task."
